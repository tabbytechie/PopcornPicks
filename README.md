# PopcornPicks

A movie recommendation platform, structured as an enterprise-grade **Modular Monolith**:
one repository, one frontend, one backend, one PostgreSQL database - organised into
many independent modules that can each be extracted into a microservice later
**without rewriting the project**.

## Architecture at a glance

```

|                   Platform modules (security, messaging, scheduler, vector, geospatial, audit, monitoring, performance, backup, restore)

### Design decisions (see `docs/decisions/`)

- **Modular Monolith over microservices** (ADR-0001)
- **PostgreSQL-first** single data store - no Redis / MongoDB / Elasticsearch / Kafka (ADR-0002)
- **All external APIs (TMDB, AI) are hidden behind the backend** (ADR-0003)
- **Feature-based frontend modules** with `@/` path aliases (ADR-0004)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18 & npm ([install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating))
- A TMDB API key, used **only by the backend** (see `docs/tmdb-setup.md`)

## Getting started

### Development with the root compose file (postgres + backend + web)

```sh
# Builds the dev images and starts all three services
docker compose up -d --build

# Web (Vite dev server):  http://localhost:4309
# Backend (Express API):  http://localhost:2789   (health: /health)
# Postgres:               localhost:5433          (container 5432)
```

`TMDB_API_KEY` / `JWT_SECRET` are read from `apps/backend/.env` at runtime (that file
is never copied into an image). Host ports can be overridden with `WEB_PORT` and
`BACKEND_PORT`. Source under `apps/*/src` and `packages/` is bind-mounted, so edits
hot-reload; rebuild with `docker compose up -d --build` after changing a `package.json`.

### Development with the full Docker platform

```sh
# 1. Copy environment file
cp docker/configs/.env.example .env

# 2. Start all services (PostgreSQL, backend, frontend, admin)
docker/scripts/start.sh dev

# 3. Access services
# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:3001
# Admin: http://localhost:5174
# pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050 (optional)
```

### Development without Docker

```sh
# 1. Install dependencies (installs all apps/* and packages/* workspaces)
npm install

# 2. Configure + start the backend (http://localhost:4000)
cp apps/backend/.env.example apps/backend/.env   # then set TMDB_API_KEY
npm run dev:backend

# 3. Start the frontend dev server (http://localhost:8080)
npm run dev

# 4. Build the frontend
npm run build

# 5. Lint
npm run lint
```

> The frontend never talks to TMDB directly - all catalog data is served by the
> backend proxy at `/api/*` so the TMDB key stays server-side (ADR-0003).
